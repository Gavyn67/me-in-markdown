## Introduction

My name is Gavyn and I am currently in 11th grade. An interesting fact about me is that I am left-handed. This school year I am planning to challenge myself so I have set some strong goals. I want to earn an A in every class that I have and achieve high scores on my AP exams. These goals are very important to me because I want to prepare well for future education and I want to challenge myself.

During the summer, when the weather was hot, I enjoyed eating ice cream which was refreshing. One of the most memorable experiences I had was going to Six Flags over the summer. This is a memory that stood out to me because I had a lot of fun riding all the rides. One of my favorite memories at Six Flags with my friends was going on Drop of Doom because it was scary and fun.

Recently I have started to learn lua programming of Roblox so that I can create my own games. I always have enjoyed computer science and coding, so I hope to learn new programming languages and expanding my skills. I also enjoy creative activities like learning and playing music. I also like editing videos. Because I enjoy computer science I plan to pursue a career related to compuer science and programming, since I am passionate about it.
