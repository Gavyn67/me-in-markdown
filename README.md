## Introduction

My name is Gavyn and I am in 11th grade. An interesting fact about myself is that I am left handed. Some goals I have for the upcoming school year is to get an A in every class and good AP scores. A favorite food I enjoyed during the summer is ice cream because it was very hot. I hope to learn new languages of code in this class. The most memorable experience I had during the summer was going to Six Flags and it stood out to me because I had a lot of fun there.

Recemtly I started learning luau on Roblox so that I can make games. A creative activity I did was playing music. A favorite memory I made with friends over the summer is going on drop of doom at six flags
